        I'm a 3D ARTIST and FULL STACK DEVELOPER with expertise in creating compelling 
        and user-friendly designs. With a strong background in both creative and technical 
        aspects of design, I succeed in transforming complex ideas into intuitive, beautiful creations. <br/>
        <br/>
        I recently completed a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Art and Technology at the University of Oregon. 
        My time in the College of Design has provided me with a solid foundation in both artistic principles and specialized technical skills.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Along with my degree, I have also completed an intensive eight-month full stack developer bootcamp at Career Foundry, which has equipped me with 
        valuable coding skills and a deeper understanding for web and software development.

        ABOUT ME <br/>
        <br/>
        Besides my passion for technology and design, I love to play games, watch movies and anime, as well as spend time in nature with my one year old 120 pound Great Dane Apple!
